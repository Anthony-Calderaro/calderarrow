### 3 years to FinTech

After college, I started working in public accounting which was a phenomenal job for a [number of reasons](link). After a few years, patterns began to emerge when performing similar tasks across different clients, and I believed I could automate some of them. At the time, the scope of work I believed could be automated was small enough that I could do myself, so I set out to learn enough programming to make me more efficient.

The tasks I believed could be automated were objective, procedural, and straightforward – boring stuff. Naturally, I started learning Python with the aptly named [_Automate the Boring Stuff with Python_ https://automatetheboringstuff.com/](link). I was particularly optimistic because they had several chapters which were directly related to my boring tasks – web scraping (chapter 12), spreadsheets (chapter 13), PDF documents (15), and email (18). Public accounting provides a great amount of autonomy and freedom – oftentimes our contracts would be fixed cost, so if we finished all the work allotted to us, we could spend the time getting ahead on other work or do trainings. At the time, I was involved in both the audit and tax teams, so when the tax busy season ended I rotated into the audit busy season, and I wasn’t able to dive into the book for months after I initially found it.

In 2017 I got the opporunity to subcontract on a federal audit with another firm whose office was across the street from us – KPMG. The large auditors were required to bring on a certain number of local accountants, and our firm had partnered with them for over a decade to send a few of our auditors over to help with the year-end audits of whatever federal clients they had. I was able to join the federal audit of the Department of Commerce and Patent and Trademark Office. The year end schedule was particularly grueling, and our contract explicitly allocated a certain number of butts-in-seats each week. For me, it was about 65 hours, Monday through Saturday (which is quite cushy compared to other finance jobs). Perks of federal clients, I suppose.

This hourly requirement was fixed, regardless of the work available. Because of the scale of the client, each associate was given responsibility over specific account types, and because it was the same client for the entire contract, I wasn’t able to use my spare time to get ahead on other clients. This culminated in a handful of hours every evening where I was able to actually start learning programming, and gave me a direct incentive to automate my work – the less I had to do, the more time I could spend automating other tasks!

The first task I automated was a compliance related task I had to do on every client to ensure that there were no new regulatory procedures which would impact our audit schedule. This involved going to a webpage, logging in, going to another webpage, saving the page as a PDF, adding a text box in the upper corner of the first page and adding boilerplate documentation depending on whether or not there were new procedures, and add it to our case files. In all the times I had to perform this task, I never encountered a time where our audit procedures were impacted.

I could do this task in about 4 minutes, but the python script I wrote could do it in about 20 seconds. The first time I ran it, I remember thinking I’d grab coffee while I wait for it to finish, and before I could grab my mug, the terminal was finished and the PDF was in our case files. I was floored – all I had to do was open the file to make sure the documentation was correct and it was done!
Walking over to grab my coffee, I started to think a bit more about how significant of a discovery this was. Saving a few minutes on each client isn’t material, but saving 90% was amazing. I had significantly underestimated how effective software could be applied to financial services, and my mind started to think of all the other tasks that I could automated. In the time it took to walk back to my desk, I couldn’t see why 2/3rds of my job couldn’t be automated. It was like an epiphany – this was the future of financial services. This was where I should be!

Reading hacker news, I was familiar with lots of people who were self-taught developers. Maybe it’s because of my accounting background, but I was skeptical about my ability to learn software development on my own – and even if I could learn on my own, getting professionally taught would expedite my learning process. I wanted to work on large scale financial technology and I was relatively early into my career, so I didn’t mind going back to school. Having a graduate degree, I was familiar with academia, so I started looking at graduate programs in computer science.

I remember asking if I could load up on credits to complete the program quicker, because their schedules assumed 15 credits per semester, and I was willing to quit my job and do school full-time if I could finish the program in a year. Because of how prerequisites and scheduling were outlined, this wasn’t possible. The general consensus was that because of my non-technical background, it’d take about two years to get a degree. Two years and about fifty-thousand dollars.

In august, I read https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15011033. During the summer, my roommate had started a programming bootcamp. His was about 15 weeks long and exclusively taught JavaScript because he was interested in being a frontend developer. I spoke with him about the program, and it seemed to be exactly what I was looking for: 8 hours a day, a focus on the practical application of developing software. I did some back-of-the-napkin math:

15 credits / semseter _ 2 years = 4 semesters @ 15 weeks / semesetr = 60 weeks _ 15 credits = 900. Add an extra 50% for labs, projects, studying (and discounting syllabus weeks, exam days, etc) and I figured ~1500 hours for a Masters in CS.
1500 / 50 = 30 weeks, assuming I put in an extra 10 hours or so each week out of class ~ 6-7 months in a bootcamp

Now I was open to these alternative programs, but I needed to make sure it taught the languages I wanted to work with. I searched the job pages of companies I would want to work for once I finish – companies like Stripe, Paypal, Capital 1, Renaissance, etc. I made a list of four key languages: JavaScript (for web apps), Java (for mobile development and banking systems), C++ (for trading); Python (for data science and financial analysis).

I had started learning Python and liked the idea of working with web apps so my work could be more accessible, so I decided that if I could learn two or three of these languages, I’d be in a good position to break into the industry.

I recalled Lambda was just over 5 months and taught C++, Python, and JS. It was the closest I found to checking all the boxes, but what really made my buy in was the [income share agreement](). Their ISA at the time was 17% of my income for 2 years, and I’d only have to pay while employed. While more expensive than debt, I gained a risk-free guarentee [note – technically, the risk was 6 months of forgone earnings, but if I didn’t get employement during my summer or winter breaks, there’d be a similar amount of lost earnings had I done a graduate degree. ] that I’d be learning the skills needed to actually develop professional software, something that I wasn’t guarantee with a graduate degree [note: the worst thing for Lambda is I go and learn everything from them, then go back to work in public accounting and use the trools they taught me in a non-engineering role. That would exempt me from the ISA requirement, and after 5 years, I could transition to fintech scott free!]. That’s a reasonable premium to pay for Lambda to take that risk off my books.

I completed the precourse application in November, which was also a green flag for me. It was self-paced and outlined so anyone could learn how to complete it, filtering out students who weren’t committed to the program.

I was accepted the week of Thanksgiving in November for the December batch, but after tellling my family in over Thanksgiving dinner, I pushed it back to the new year because of how adamantly against it they were. I got a similarly visceral reaction from talking to my grandparents when we visted in December, and ultimately pushed my start date back to March.

I always went to my parents and grandparents for advice – they’re like my personal board of directors. 99.99% of the time, I’m missing something or not thinking rationally about an issue, and they’re right on the money. This was the first time I felt like they were the ones missing something big.

“There’s less money in IT.”; “You’ve already got an accounting background, why do you want to get into technology?” “it’s risky” “you should get an MBA”

They didn’t seem to grasp the financial aspect of financial-technology. And the fact that they kept couldn’t understand the difference between IT and software development was a red flag. The MBA was somewhat compelling, but what value would a 25 year old really get out ofthat? I decided to save that for later.

Unconvinced, I put in my notice the week after my birthday in January[note my employer was really great, all things considered, [link to accounting as a great first job]. My last day in public accounting was Friday, March 2nd 2018 and my first day as a software developer was Monday, March 5th.

I graduated in the middle of September and started my first job in October. I wasn’t accepted at any financial technology companies, but I joined a small geospatial consultancy that was great for helping me professionally develop (note: pun intended). I primarily worked on the front end, but got to dabble in Python and had the opportunity to learn cloud infrastructure since a primary vendor was a major AWS partner and another client of ours was Microsoft. Overall, it was a great learning opportunity, and my starting salary was 30% more than where I was when I left public accounting.

After a year or so, I worked to get onto more of a full-stack project which was with a large, billion-dollar commercial real estate company. It was awesome – except the following year when COVID-19 hit and commercial real estate took a nose dive.

During summer 2020, I felt like I was ready to move to a bigger, financial-technology role. I applied for a job at Capital One, went through the interview, and passed...I think?

I got a call in mid-August from Capital One. They wanted to hire me but apparently they just filled the job, and because there wasn’t any more availability, they couldn’t actually hire me. They said they would keep me in their system and if anything opened up within 6 months, they’d call me and I wouldn’t have to re-interview. I thought that was their way of letting me down easy.

After a few months of commercial real estate being in the sewers, my client issued a stop work order, and I got fired the following month in September 2020. Ironically, I had just paid off my last month of ISA payments to Lambda School.

I called the Capital One recruiter who indicated that there still weren’t any opportunities, but that more may open in the new year. I figured I couldn’t count on a Capital One job, so I started searching for new jobs.

I was in a uniquely fortunate situation. We had just refinanced our home, paid down my ISA and my wife’s outstanding student loans. We would be able to live off her income without dipping into savings, and she was more than supportive of me being more selective with my job search for a few weeks while I focus on interviewing with financial technology companies. Because COVID has pushed everyone remote, I felt like I was able to apply to a broader range of companies which would have been geographically restricted during normal times, so I wanted to take advantage of it.

At the same time, I couldn’t wait forever for the dream job. I made a 6 month job hunting plan: I’d be extremely selective in the first two months, then expand my search to anything in the financial or technology space, and after four months, I would apply to any job I was qualified for.

After the first couple of weeks searching for jobs, I realized that I was going through job boards faster than jobs were being posted, so I couldn’t spend more than few hours applying for jobs each day. I got back into running, but also decided to try to finish my CPA designation, as I had met all the requirements other than passing some of the exams[note I still had credit from one until December 2020]. I woke up, applied to jobs, went for a run, then studied.

[Table of jobs].

In November, I made it to the final round of a fintech company, but they told me they decided they no longer wanted to fill the role, so I wouldn’t be extended an offer. I told them I understood – since that was a strangely familiar response.

Over the course of 6 weeks, I took the remaining 3 CPA exams and was officially licensed in early December, which was just in time for me to start expanding my applications to financial and accounting related jobs. In the middle of December, I applied to a phenomanl [link] program at Microsoft, which I encourage anyone with a non-traditional background to apply to. The week of Christmas, I received and accepted an offer from the U.S. Tax Court in something of a support engineer role troubleshooting tickets from users and helping to develop new features. I was making less than I was making as an accountant, but it was a job that I would be able to learn a lot from, and it was tangentially related to the fin-tech space, insomuch as I was working on software to help people manage their outstanding cases with the tax court.

I started the first Monday of January and withdrew myself from consideration from the other jobs I had applied to – with 2 exceptions.

One was microsoft. After I appplied, there was no follow up address so I didn’t know how to withdraw my application. I didn’t think I’d get it anyway, but they invited me to interview in January and I received an offer to start in March. I think they liked my business/financial background and the fact that I was somewhat technical. Excel is the quintessential took in finance, so it would have been great to work on that team!

The only downside was that it was a 16 week apprenticeship with no guarentee of a job. Contracted through a hiring agency, I’d also be making non-microsoft salaries, but it was more still more than what I was making at the Tax Court. It would suck to leave so soon into a new role, but I’d try to put in more than 2 weeks notice sometime in the middle of February.

Which brings me to the second exception – in second week of February, the second company I forgot to withdraw from called me – Capital One. They scheduled a meeting with technical manager and they followed up a few days later with an offer stage. Had they waited until March, I would have had to reapply.

They gave me more than the low end of my offer range, plus a signing bonus, and ther office is 4 miles away from me in Tysons, VA – so I could bike!

I was then put into the unique position of having to withdraw from the Microsoft program and a job I started less than 6 weeks ago. It was awkward, but the Tax Court is really an amazing team – I felt terrible about leaving so soon, but they were understanding. Their HR team actually mentioned that it happens quite often because the public sector can’t always compete with private – she had actually left a governmnet job within 90 days herself! It was a great eight weeks though, and I really value the opporutnity I had to interface with actual users of the product. We were getting people requesting (or rudely demanding) new functionality every week – talk about product market fit! I learned a ton in such a short period of time. Their product is being developed in the open – and if you have a chance to contribute, you can do so here.

I started with Capital One in March – I finally made it to FinTech! I’m a software engineer, working on fascinating financial technology at a scale I could never have imagined. I can’t wait to go back to the office[link].

For me, FinTech presents an amazing opportunity to do good in the world. Every individual is involved in a global financial system, but not everyone is financially literate. FinTech provides a way to leverage technology to make this system more transparent, accessible, and affordable. It’s not heart surgery, but it provides a lot more value than squeezing as many advertisements as possible into users. I’m incredibly privileged to be here.

What a long, strange journey it’s been.

P.S. Capital One is hiring! Let me know if you’re interested and I’d love to help you any way I can.
