      {/* <p style={{ lineHeight: '2rem' }}>Our team obtains updated bank data and adds dozens of new accounts and products every day. Unlike other companies[Quora link] or blogs offering financial advice that provide you with a preselected number of options and recommend the best from that pool of choices, so they can receive kickbacks or show more advertisements. We don't serve ads, and we don't exclude any companies or products. We intentionally seek out the most accurate, up-to-date information on as many products as humanly possible, to ensure that you're making a fully informed decision.</p>
      
      <h1>Prioritizing Everyday Customers</h1>

Unlike household products, comparing financial products can be done objectively. We are able to precisely assess the price and quality of financial products by evaluating the return, price (including fees), and risk. By aggregating as much data as possible for as many products as possible, you know that your finanical decisions are in good hands with bankrank.</p>
      
      <h1>Operating Without Biases</h1>
      <p style={{ lineHeight: '2rem' }}>Companies cannot pay-to-win. We do not offer sponsorships, premium partnerships, or advertisements. They compete against each other -- we act as the referree by defining the terms of engagement which align with our customers' needs.</p>
      
      <h1>The End Result</h1>
