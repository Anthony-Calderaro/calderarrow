# What is Nepotism. Why is it bad

purest form of privilege. Getting something because of a personal relationship, and even worse,a relationship based out of "obligation" rather than some other basis. A friend is chosen, a family member is given.

Type of favortism, which is itself a form of discrimination. One can discriminate on race, sex, religious creed, national origin, or personal relation. Nepotism is concerned with the later.

Negatively impacts organizations which receive subpar talent and allow excellent talent to go to competitors
negatively impacts the team with subpar talent
negatively impacts peers because they have to take on more slack
negatively impacts customers because they receive worse service
negatively impacts bosses because they feel compelled to manage through the shit employee
negatively impacts the person who didn't get the job, contributes to their feelings of discrimination, causes deep-seeted animosity
negatively impacts the giver of nepositm, as it makes them appear less fair and just, while also increasing their responsibility over an incompetent individual
negatively impacts the beneficiary, by promoting imposter syndrome and taking away a sense of confidence in being able to set out and accomplish a goal on their own.

What are the benefits?
A way to repay a debt
A weapon to screw with a rival (intentionally favoring someone less able)

Superficial pride. It is hallow, however, because it is built on appearence and postering. It comes from top-down, rather than from the support and faith of ones peers and subordinates.

# Innocuous nepotism

Similar situation with children of successful immigrants. Asian families own a small business and want their kids to take over, Jewish families owned tax or legal practices. Nepotism wasn’t unusual, but it wasn’t for me.
Nepotism doesn’t always come from malicious intent, but it allows for cronyism. Maybe I wouldn’t have been so against it if it weren’t for an essential product, but I couldn’t justify the cost to patients. I tend to frame decisions as whether or not they would hurt or help my future children, and if nepotism delayed the release or development of a life saving therapeutic my child needed, I would hate the management of the company for it.

# Personal relationship with nepotism

Benefitted from it with internships
didn’t impact my ability to get other jobs, unsure if due to my major
had opportunity to get job after college
chose not to for multiple reasons:

1. hurts my growth
2. hurts my team
3. hurts patients

# Natural Correcting it

The market is an excellent correction for rampant nepotism. Let the largest companies hire their kids into executive roles. They'll be bloated, less agile, less profitable than the more capable talent which starts their own competitor.

Monarchy is nepotism applied to centralized power. There are still some in existence, just like some nepostism exists in market economies, but they are a decreasing minority.

Ability beats pedigree

’’are people allowed to wish for orivledge in their children? If not, are people allowed to bring underprivileged in the world?’’’ Choosing to have fewer kids v choosing to have many kids.

I had a basketball coach who told us that the way you know someone cares is when they
give you attention. If a coach didn't care about you as a player, they wouldn't yell at you
if u messed up.
I believe that's true, and I can say that Lilia has not stopped caring about me since we
first started our friendship. But it's not just me -- she cares deeply about everyone and
everything. For some, her feedback can be offputting, but for those that take it to heart,
it's transformational. She takes an active role in helping everything and everyone around her
be better -- most of all, me. Not everyone cares enough to let you know when you can improve,
but she does, and she's helped me be the best me I can be.
