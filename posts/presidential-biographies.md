[Meacham's biography on Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Meacham#Bibliography)

[Meacham's biography on Andrew Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Meacham#Bibliography)

- Grant

- Washington: [1776](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1776_(book)>) by McCullough
- [Adams](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams_(book)>). Fabulous book, companion to the HBO show, single-handedly gave me a deep appreciation for New England and a desire to find a companion like Abigail. His sheer work ethic is inspirational.
- [Truman via the accidental president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Baime). Embodies the spirit of ordinary Americans rising to the occassion to serve not only their country, but the world.
- Theodore Rosevelt: [River of Doubt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_River_of_Doubt)
  American Idealism. American Exceptionalism without pomp of monarchy. Willingness to do what is best for America domestically and internationally, and sense of adventure as a way of self-improvement embodies the innovative, curious,entreprenurial culture of Americans.
- [Hamilton](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton_(book)>) by Chernow
  Incredibly humble beginnings, endowed with prodigious financial acumen. Devised robust systems which encourage faith in humanity but are not vulnerable to the most evil of men.
- [Grant](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_(book)>) by Chernow, who was most impressive in his resilience coming from humble beginnings, being orphaned, and rising up to earn his respectthroughthe military, and leading on the battlefield, not in an office.

Story about colleague @ c1 whose background was John quincy, lost a bet.
