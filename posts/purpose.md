Core values dictate your lifes purpose. As you move towards things you value, you will move away from other things and focus your attention to a smaler number of tasks.

It doesn't matter wjat u do, as long as what u do doesn't hurt yourself or others around you. You don't have to help other people around you, but make sure that you're not making life worse for them. It's okay to focus on yourself. I think most people should. Once you take care of yourself, you may find yourself wanting to do more, and that's the opportunity to start helping others. Avoid doing something for other people's reasons. Most importantly, be honest with yourself.
