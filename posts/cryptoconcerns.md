1. Environmental use
Crypto as a primary currency in the world is unlikely. 
3. Can't call cops on your digital wallet.

I’m thinking dollar-denominated

Reliance on internet. Inconvenience but not a deal breaker.

Government backed. Someone needs to bash skulls if people don’t pay
- underlying value. It serves a purpose like gold or it’s valuable because a government with nukes says it is

Gives advantages to the underprivileged. The wealthy and privileged will resist this. They own corporations, they own the banks, they can choose to not allow crypto. They can’t exactly do that with dollars, since the government backs the dollars, whereas consumers and businesses back crypto
- and why would a government back a crypto when they have more control over a currency

Libertarian/anarchist sterotypes that somehow can't trust their democratically elected governments to manage currency but can trust all the intermediary agencies and departments to not break 
So it’s entirely possible, just like it’s possible for the world to go carbon neutral, vegetarian, quit smoking, end all wars tomorrow. But there's a difference between possibility and probability. Crypto as a secondary asset-class which people invest or speculate in? Probable. Crypto as a de facto world currency used to facilitate trade and exchange? Probably not.
