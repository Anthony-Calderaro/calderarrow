### Book Review: Frederick Douglass


The book is only 100 pages long, easily enough to read. I believe I will read it every Juneteenth until I find a more poignant book which conveys so much for so few words. 

I happened to choose to read this book several months ago, alongside books by Henrietta lacks and Harriet Tubman. I happened to select them by chance. For my honeymoon, my wife and I went to harpers ferry, and in learning about John brown I learned that Harriet Tubman had said he had done more for slaves than Lincoln, high praise indeee, and I wanted to read something by her. My wife had recently finished lacks — a book I received as a freshman in college but embarrassingly had never read.

In learning about Harriet Tubman, I was reminded of Douglas. I had read his speeches and bookmarked several, as I wished to study not only the content but the way in which that were created. I felt compelled to read about him on this day, since it is the first time the  federally government is recognizing Juneteenth

Admittedly, I was not able to finish it all on Saturday, since I had attended a wedding the night before and was not able to rouse myself in time to finish the reading before evening, when I had to volunteer at the fire station. I finished it the following day, just in time for my Bible study with my mom.

 
Preface
Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglas:

I love that the cover says written by himself. That’s bad ass, and even more so because he was black and a slave, at a time when both were disadvantageous 

It is consecrated work to break the rod of the oppressor and let the oppressed go free.

Imagine how much distrust he could have bad in whit people, and yet he continued to work and pursue his cause alongside abolitionists, white and black.

Part of the goal of enslavement is to degrade and reduce so that it’s continuation could be perpetuated. Every slave who retained their hope defied that intention, and the few who were able to get out and live to tell their story struck the most critical of blows against the institution — their very existence serves as a reminder of the brittle foundation slavery resides. 

Chapter 1
I look for indications of an authors bias his refers to other children knowing about their age as a privilege he was denied, rather than a right. This is true, but it can be easy for people who feel they are victims of injustice to see rights taken away when they are not rights, and it was reassuring to see him make a clear distinction given how much of a victim he was. It’s also impressive 

Slaves were not necessarily families in bondage, but truly alone, ripped apart and denied basic familiar privileges we take for granted. It’s an unusually cruel punishment to inflict on another being

Chapter 3

The fact that masters were able to have children with slaves but thrust the children into servitude is barbaric, dishonorable, and fundamentally flawed with humanity. I’m not half way through the first chapter and I feel more infuriation at slaverholders. I have heard the horrrors of slavery told in schools and textbooks, but this man has ignited an infuriated rage in me toward my fellow countrymen. I hate that Americans had slaves. I hate American slave holders

Of course his masters name is Anthony 

Chapter 4
They act so savagely to weed out insubordination because they are afraid of the slaves rising up and doing to them what they are doing to them. They know it’s wrong. 

It’s interesting that damned is censored but not nigger, as in our times it would seem that the latter carries a weight of unspeakable proportions. (I only do this because n word could refer to negro, which is uncensored as well)

chapter 5
The fact that he could hold his good spirits despite what he endured, and still believe in god, is a testament of true faith. I doubt I will ever encounter such a trial, and even worse, I doubt I would leave with my faith intact

Chapter 6
Ignorance was how they kept slaves enslaved. What use are the chains if their minds can’t comprehend their predicament? How can they revolution if they have no idea of freedom — and the fact that they _should_ be free. That they _could_ be free

The fact that his master hated him learning was evidence of its merits. His first act of rebellion would be to learn to read. How remarkable that I was able to learn to read casually and without memory. I can’t remember a time I couldn’t read! Yet he remembers quite vividly the earliest lessons and the moment it became his focus. 

Interestingly, the cnvsnity of urban life played a benefit to slaves. In the same way urbanites take great care of their linens and vehicles, so too did early urbanites take care of their other property: slaves

Chapter 7

His accurate anger was impotent. Had he condemned all white propel, he would not have learned to read from the white urchins. He was angry with his enemies but did not allow his anger to cloud his judgment — and so he did not pass judgment on those who ended up giving him what he desired

He is tormented by his thinking, and mad at his fellow slave for their ignorance. It truly is bliss. But he may also hold them accountable, for if they knew they could do something 
This book is fabulous  because it is a story of a boy learning how to put words to the thoughts and observations he experiences. It is a man who is himself unfree, learns about his condition and sets out to pursue freedom. For someone like me who was, is, and with most likely old Will always be free, it is a pure sensation of ecstasy. Freedom will never mean to me what it means to him, but this knowledge makes me appreciate my freedom more

His story about learning to write is amazing, and encompasses the idea of making your own luck. Here he was in this horrific predicament, yet he chose to put himself in positions to maximize his opportunity: getting lessons by playing at white boys pride, copying notes when his mistress was out. He couldn’t have known how valuable it would have been. But he had an idea, and looked for opportunities to further achieve his goal. Yes, there was an element of luck, but also a great deal of effort. This is true of most people .

It may be that my misery in slavery will only increase my happiness when I get free. There is a better day coming.”
Thus I used to think, and thus I used to speak to myself; goaded almost to madness at one moment, and at the next reconciling myself to my wretched lot.

Perhaps he is so honest with himself and us because he sees the deception of slavery in tricking slaves with freedom. He must hate deception.  

More comfort brought more desire for freedom. Because his work ethic increases and he realizes that what he wants he cannot buy.

I was now getting, as I have said, one dollar and fifty cents per day. I contracted for it; I earned it; it was paid to me; it was rightfully my own; yet, upon each returning Saturday night, I was compelled to deliver every cent of that money to Master Hugh. And why? Not because he earned it,—not because he had any hand in earning it,—not because I owed it to him,—nor because he possessed the slightest shadow of a right to it; but solely because he had the power to compel me to give it up. The right of the grim-visaged pirate upon the high seas is exactly the same. 

Taxation is theft ^

When I carried to him my weekly wages, he would, after counting the money, look me in the face with a robber-like fierceness, and ask, “Is this all?” He was satisfied with nothing less than the last cent. He would, however, when I made him six dollars, sometimes give me six cents, to encourage me. It had the opposite effect. I regarded it as a sort of admission of my right to the whole. The fact that he gave me any part of my wages was proof, to my mind, that he believed me entitled to the whole of them.

He is a brilliant strategist/tactician. He doesn’t divulge details which would make his narrative richer, or stab the egos of slaveholders,  ecause it could omit other slaves chance at freedom
