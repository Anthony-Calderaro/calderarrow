# The Future of Remote Work

1. Taking Inventory of Current Trends
Labor-based work is being outsourced. 
Skilled-labor is being outsourced (cheaper states, eastern Europe, Eastern Asia)
General push among American Individual contributors for remote work. 

Anecdotally, it seems like most big US businesses are anti-Remote work, or at the very least reluctant to go remote, but quite capable of doing so -- as we've witnessed during the [pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covid_19_pandemic). There are a number of reasons why -- organizational inertia, disincentives between workers and management, perceived risks of moving remote -- but most of these reasons are superficial, shortsighted, or both. Over time, we should expect an increasing amount of remote work for those where it is possible.

The sheer cost of corporate real estate and overhead alone is enough of a justification. Companies in major metro areas can spend more than $30 per square foot for office space, and assuming at least 100 square feet per employee, that's at least $3000 per employee. For a small business of 20 people, going remote can be enough savings to hire an extra employee -- increasing productivity by 5% without adding any new accounts, increasing prices, or cutting benefits. Add in the savings for utilies, snacks, on-site benefits, parking, commuter benefits, and the example becomes even more compelling. For companies which have plataued or matured, migrating to a fully remote workplace could be a way to materially improve their share price. Management may not care, but Wall Street will.

The recent trend shows Americans getting more involved with the tech industry. As technical talent becomes more distributed across the country, talent will become accessible from more affordable regions. In order to tap into the best-of-the-best, companies will need to accomodate remote workers or continue to pay inflated salaries to justify them relocating to expensive regions. This will become increasingly difficult as more employees get a taste for the benefits of remote work and simply refuse to work in an office environment. 


### Benefits & Challenges

More specifically, I expect that a major shift towards remote work will result in the following benefits and externalities in the short-term, affecting different stakeholders, well, differently. 

Benefits:
  to Workers:
  - Improved employee productivity 
  - Improved happiness and work/life balance

  to Employers:
  - More technical, affordable, and expansive talent pool
  - Cost savings from decreased wages and overhead

  to the Global Community:
  - Increased diversity (of ideas and workers)
  - Improved environmental footprint from reduced need of commuting, parking, and commercial buildings
  - Improved global immigration (from developed countries -> developing countries)

Challenges:
  to Workers:
  - Material reduction in developed-nation workforces wages
  - Difficulty living in high-cost areas
  - Potential for a more isolated, lonely workforce
  - Normalization of "always on" work expectations 
  
  to Employers:
  - Challenges developing a company culture
  - Challenges developing team comraderie
  
  to the Global Community:
  - Weaponization of citizenship

### The Future Reality

I think a mostly-remote workforce would be a net gain for the global community, but large, metropolitan cities in developed countries -- and specifically, the employees in those areas -- would bear the brunt of the costs over the long-term. But in the short term, some remote workers will have an opportunity to take advantage of geographic-employer-arbitrage by moving to a less expensive regions while retaining their metropolitan salary. This loophole will eventually close as companies adapt their labor costs to reflect a global labor force and update their relocation policies. 

As it currently stands, companies can recruit top talent from anywhere in the world and force new hires to relocate if they want the job. Usually, this involves going to a larger city and comes with a corresponding increase in pay, but there's no reason they can't do it in reverse. Instead of "Here's a quarter-million dollars, move to San Francisco," what if they said "Here's 10 grand. Move to Kyiv." $10k is almost a third of [California's minimum wage](), but nearly [5x the minimum wage in Ukraine](). Of course, this ignores a worse-case scenario in which the compay just hires someone local to that geographic region in the first place. With billions of people competing against American technologists, workers won't have much leverage. Unions will have even less. 

Depending on how early politicians become aware of these concerns, we may see a rise in populist or protectionist policies, including restrictions on immigration, outsourcing, or locality requirements levied on businesses that want to do business in the States. But legal systems won't be able to stave off the negative conseqeunces forever. Reincorporating a fully-remote business could happen in a few weeks, whereas legislation operates on an exponentially slower scale. 

### Problem? Solution?

So is this a problem, and if so, is it something we should try to stop? It's certainly not a problem today, and it really won't be unless a critical mass of software employers in the States go fully-remote. Doing so would accelerate the globalization of labor costs and economically bolster regions around the globe which have been somewhat left behind by recent technological advances, but as a biased, selfish American, I'm most concerned with:
- The weaponization of citizenship (especially among countries which stand to lose the most from a more globalized tech market)
- A sharp decline in wealth for sopeople who are in developed countries, like America.
- Increased wealth inequality between tech-laborers and tech-capitalists. Investors can be citizens in a tax haven for individuals, own companies headquartered in corporate tax havens, and hire labor cheaply from an entirely globalized tech workforce.
- Increased (or at the very least, a stabilization) of authoritative governments, particularly those in developing nations with larger populations, as a result of weakened Developed countries' economic and legal influence

It would be hypocritical of me to [talk about an issue](/awareness) without actually contributing to a solution, but the challenge with this is that it may be a non-issue. It may never actually occur. It may, and if it does, I'm not quite sure what we can do about it. Instead, I'd like to offer an approach to deter the situation altogether: a dynamic, hybrid workforce.

The biggest risk with pushing for a fully-remote workplace on an individual scale is that given enough people demanding full-time remote work, the economic landscape will change irrevocibly. A hybrid approach would allow employees to work remotely or in-person, and having it applied dynamically would empower teams to tune the ratio of remote : in-person according to their needs and preferences.

Not enough to just say one thing and do another. Otherwise companies can force the hand. Instead, embrace a hybrid culture and actually leverage the benefits it provides. Build team comraderie, use the corporate gym, roast your boss. Stay late on a friday night with your colleagues to meet a critical deadline. It's a small price to pay to maintain the stability and consistency we have now.

5. Conclusion
This has been mostly a knowledge dump of my thought process. I'm certainly no expert in soceio-economic trends, but by posting my thoughts publically I hope to benefit from [Cunningham's Law](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law), and in the off-chance that I'm correct, start a discussion about it sooner rather than later. 

Personally, I would love a hybrid schedule where Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays are in-office and Mondays and Fridays are remote-first. Remote first meaning people can come in or schedule meetings in office space, but no one is required to show physically, nor are they penalized for calling in. But ideally, companies would embrace a hybrid approach and defer to individual teams to decide what is best for them. There are some teams or roles which really don't need the overhead of an office, whereas others may require them. As long as the company as a whole is neither 100% in-person nor 100% remote, I think the risks of remote work leading to the decline of American influence in the international community is a non-issue.
