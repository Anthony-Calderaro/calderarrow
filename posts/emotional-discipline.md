### Developing Emotional Discipline

June 2021

How do you build emotional discipline to say “no” to Mr. Market? Practice. If you don’t have money, go to a mall or a crowded city street. Usually you can find all sorts of people on the sides of streets and walkways offering to sell you something, get your donation, signature, or attention. Walk right by them. If you feel inclined, politely decline without breaking stride. See? They probably won’t like you, but who cares! You don’t need everyone to like you.
