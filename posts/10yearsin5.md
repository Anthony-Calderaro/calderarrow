### Living 10 years in 5

April 2002

MY dad used to tell me to try not to lose time. At a bare minimum, make sure you get a year for every year you live. A year wiser, stronger, bolder.

People fall behind by living 5 years in 10. They lose time, they drift, and life is more difficult than it is for others.

The opposite can happen: living 10 years in 5.

Reading. Reading a story lets you live much quicker than reality. Listening is effective to, but not as much. Both are more effective than learning the hard way, by firsthand expeirence, although somethings are more enjoyable this way. Immerse yourselves in other people's lives. Learn from their mistakes, learn to identify similar opportunties in your own life. This lets you learn from your own mistakes and theirs, whereas they spent their life only learning from their mistakes. 


Taking calculated risks. A challenging assignment, venturing out of your comfort zone. Taking on more responsibility sooner will enable you to take on more responsibility later on. Challenge yourself. Think critically, and don't be caught up by pride.

Why bother? because we have a limited amount of time, and a seemingly limitless number of paths to take. If some are dead ends, knowing which paths are dead ends ahead of time saves us the hassle -- and trauma -- of venturing out on our own. But there's no guarantee that we find the ideal path ourselves, even with prudence.

But there's always hope for the next generation.
