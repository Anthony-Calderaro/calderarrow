"“When evening has come, I return to my house and go into my study. At the door I take off my clothes of the day, covered with mud and mire, and I put on my regal and courtly garments; and decently reclothed, I enter the ancient courts of ancient men, where, received by them lovingly, I feed on the food that alone is mine and that I was born for. There I am not ashamed to speak with them and to ask them the reason for their actions; and they in their humanity reply to me. And for the space of four hours I feel no boredom, I forget every pain, I do not fear poverty, death does not frighten me. I deliver myself entirely to them." - Niccolò Machiavelli

> I asked you what you thought about your parents. Do you remember? I asked if you felt they were perfect or if they needed improvement and do you remember what you said? You said they weren't perfect, but they don't need improvement. This is very insightful, and do you know why? Because it means you are willing to accept people as they are. Nobody's perfect, not even mom and dad. That's OK.
