### Book Review: The Intelligent Investor

June 2021

Written by [Benjamin Graham](), The Intelligent Investor serves as the foundation upon with several high-profile investors have beaten the market by a significant margin, returning somewhere around 15-25% more than the S&P 500. To do so over a brief period could be attributed to luck, but the repeated, decades-long success of Graham's value-investor disciples made me believe there must be something more scientific about investing. When reading through Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway letters, he has brought up his [appreciation]() of Graham's lessons on [numerous occassions](). If the most successful investor in history is telling the world that he learned from this Benjamin Graham fellow, it seems stupid not to see what the man is about.

To my surprise, there were numerous lessons which were immediately applicable to my own financial life, but which also flipped conventional notions upside down. The most interesting financial observation was how we understand the relationship between risk and reward. Traditionally, we are taught that people demand a higher return for higher risk, but Graham observes that by utilizing a value-investing framework to a portfolio, investors can reduce the risk of their portfolio while achieving higher returns.

This is possible by one of the core tennents of value investing: the margin of safety. By exclusively investing in ventures which are priced at or below their net asset value, investors can dramatically reduce their risk of losses, and preserve their principal along with a reasonable chance of future profit. This runs counter to the more exciting investments of today, where high-growth tech startups and cryptocurrencies are being invested in based purely on optimism and faith rather than financial metrics. In bull markets, many stock can be overvalued, so a value investor may have difficulty finding even a single good company which meets their criteria, but Graham shows through numerous decades that there have been at least a handful of companies which meet the value investor's criteria.

The most important lesson, which is stressed as early as the first chapter, is emotional discipline. Without emotional discipline, the investor is a slave to their emotions, and subsequently limits their potential gain or loss to the temperment they were born with. By developing and maintaining strict emotional discipline, one can not only avoid market folly, but profit from it. In order to beat the market, one must inherently do things that the majority are not doing. Being able to not only believe that the majority is wrong, but actually take a stand against the majority is something humans are not naturally wired to do. The good news is that emotional discipline can be [learned](emotional-discipline), and the more you invest in your own emotional discipline, the better you will perform.

My only complaint was that I had not read this book sooner. And that surprises me, because I have undergraduate and graduate degrees in financial accounting, and was never instructed to learn about value investing. I learned financial ratios, but never how to invest. Perhaps that was a limitation of my university's curiculum, but I am more inclined to believe that most institutions are not teaching these concepts, which is a shame, because this book is a lot cheaper than tuition.

I had initially planned on reading this for pleasure, but soon found myself taking meticulous notes, which I've included below, as if it were a textbook. I did not expect to glean so much useful information out of a relatively short book, but I am so grateful to Mr. Graham for putting his ideas down on paper, and for Mr. Buffett's glowing recommendations.

## Notes on The Intelligent Investor

# Preface

Emotional discipline is the bedrock of finance. In order to profit from market folly, we cannot participate in it. By acting emotionally, we act on folly and allow others to profit. This is true in other facets of life life.

Bull markets must eventually come to an end. This must be true, unless we are growing at precisely the maximum rate possible, which is statistically impossible. The concept is also true of bear markets.

Bear markers are penalties for greed and overestimation. The losses incurred in a bear market are more than made up for in the following bull market. It is a net good for a long term investor, and is reasonable to expect that we have periods of slow decline after periods of expansion.

There is always value in a bear market. The massess tend to be hyper-optimists and hyper-pessimists. During a bull market, they expect the growth to continue indefinitely, so prices tend to be overvalued. During bear markets, they expect the end of times, so prices can actually be discounted.

Buy from pessimists and sell to optimists.

# Introduction

Dollar cost averaging may be better than investing all your money at once, so you avoid the bad luck of getting in when it's high and about to crash. This is much preferred than trying to time the market when it's low and make money on the upswing.

Following the market is a lagging indicator. Businesses are created and then valued. The business doesn’t change because the value changes. You should be able to make a decision as to the price you'd be willing to pay for a stock without seeing a quote.

Growth in an industry does not always translate to profits. The Airplane industry grew in the mid-20th century and tanked profits even though they grew exponentially. The industry was correct, but most of the companies were duds. Even now, they are an immense industry that provides tremendous value to the world, but the businesses are unable to capture much of that value so they make less optimal investments.

Failing at investing is like failing in relationships. It’s more a matter of character than intelligence.

# Chapter 1

Investments must promise to safeguard the principle and provide an adequate return. Anything not meeting these two criteria is speculation, and more closely akin to gambling than investing.

Speculation is not always bad. Early investors in Amazon speculated that they would beat Walmart, and they were rewarded for their faith. But an intelligent investor is not looking for extraordinary returns.

Risk is never eliminated with stocks and bonds. When trying to beat the market, both the buyer and seller of a security are betting against each other. A buyer assumes the risk the stock decreases, while the seller assumes the risk the stock increases.

Buying on margin is by definition speculative unless you are a professional, since you would be offering more money than you could afford to lose.

There was a period in the 60s and 70s where money equivalents were better than stock. This defeats the logic that markets allow for us to escape the losses of inflation. It also points out that markets can never be predicted. Like life, the only thing you can control is yourself

To make money, you have to do things that are intelligent and sound but which Wall Street doesn’t do. This is mostly related to emotional discipline, since Wall Street is often ridiculed as excess and rash.

Short selling has unlimited loss with capped gain. Investing has unlimited gain with limited loss. Short selling is inherently speculative, since you are not only betting that a stock is overvalued, but that its employees will not succeede in achieving a higher valuation.

Brokers make money whethere or not you do. So they feed into your ego and vanity. They act similar to a casino, both in form and function.

Turnover of stock ownership has rapidly increased. This may present an opportunity to win for long term investors.

By looking over data over a definite period, patterns will emerge, but those patterns cannot possibly indicate future patterns. Because future data will have different variables. New companies, new regulations, new trade, new populations. This removes most of my desire to become a quant trader!

Wall Street offers trash tabloid advice, just like magazine tabloids regurgitating new fads around diets and quick ways to shed 15 pounds. A disciplined lifestyle is what makes you healthy. Disciplined investing is what gains you money.

That rush for gambling and addictive ness and easy wins is instinctive. You must control it. Once again, the important lies more on an investor's emotional discipline than financial prowess.

# Chapter 2

Common stocks cannot always be a sure defense against inflation, but as bonds have no protection, stock offers at least the possibility of protection from inflation. The inverse is true about bonds hedging against deflation.

Crypto could be interesting as a store of value and less so as a currency. But whereas gold has real life value, crypto has none. Now, a crypto that could store generic computational power would be compelling.

Inflation has a psychological component which can get in the way of macro-economic policy. A 2% raise alongside 4% inflation is the same as a 2% pay cut with no inflation. Good luck getting reelected with the latter.

People complain about savings rates being so low but forget inflation was so high in the 80s.

Inflation is an investment fee on the entire portfolio that gets paid each year, regardless of performance.

# Chapter 3

It is reasonable to expect an exactness which the subject can naturally provide. I would not expect probability from a mathematician, nor precision from an orator. Financial analysis is somewhere in between.

It seems that bull years are modest in growth and duration, whereas bear markets are sharp in decline and brief. Perhaps we get amnesia from the shock of a decline, and when we come to the market is improving so we forget what caused our terrible situation. "Like breaking your arm after a night of drunken stupor, waking up thinking you should do it again."

If every investor believes that earnings will increase, then stocks will be overvalued because belief does not translate to earnings, but it does drive up price.

"Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall enjoy everything."

# Chapter 4

Formulaic approaches cannot be long term successes because once they are known they are copied. More investors into he same stocks means higher prices and eventually this can lead to overvaluation.

Bonds may be the ideal instrument for disciplined mathematicians, as their lower volatility and straightforward pricing makes choose among highly rated bonds simple arithmetic.

Callable bonds are unfair for investors because investors bear the risk of volatility and only benefit from minor upticks when the bonds are called.

Preferred stock are also poor instruments for value investors since they are less preferred in claiming debt than bonds, and less preferred in claiming a share of earnings compared to common stock. They are preferred in dividends only.

Bond interest is deductible by the company. This can cause interesting reward opportunities for founder/owners.

Age shouldn't matter for risk. Why move money to bonds when you’re elderly? Unless your goal is to use the money yourself — but then you aren’t _really_ investing for long term, are you? Investing for the duration of your life is not long term.

Bonds are for people who sell during bear markets. If one is unable to discipline themselves during a bear market, they should avoid the hassle and put their investments in an inherently safer option.

# Chapter 5

There is always a niche reason for a financial instrument. Junk bonds provide some counterweight to interest rate increases compared to highly rated bonds. Foreign investment can offer a hedge against US operations.

Tax rates are sometimes designed to influence behavior, not necessarily to maximize tax revenue. If a retirement account is tax free, the government probably would prefer you to use it. If tax rates are lower for cap gains than day trading, they probably would prefer the later.

IPO = "It's Probabably Overpriced"

# Chapter 7

A bargain occurs when the current assets - total liabilities are as close to positive as possible, and P/E ratio is not more than 15.

Companies do not need to grow their revenue to grow their value, so long as they earn a profit. Profit becomes a dividend or directly increases cash -- and therefore equity. A growing company may not return a profit, but a profitable company will grow.

Good Company + Bad Price = Bad investment.

The richest people have historically put their entire savings in one basket. Founding a company is taking a 100% investment in a venture without earnings or assets. While it may not pass the immediate smell test, the price is sufficiently low enough to justify. But once obtained, wealth should be distributed to maintain and grow modestly.

# Chapter 8

Bear markets must happen so long as there are emotionally undisciplined investors. The nature of speculators is to earn cash quickly, so even if there is speculation propping a company up, eventually the speculators will cash out and the market will correct. If this happens across multiple companies, or an entire market, it can trigger a bear market.

The way to outrun a bear is to run faster than the person you’re running with. Similarly, the way to beat a bear market is to buy into bargain stock, and outlast the speculators you’re running against.

Investing fads can’t work because circumstances change and they have to be based on the underlying foundation. Graham’s ideas of a bargain price are an investing formula based on the financial metrics. Buy the "Dogs of the Dow" doesn’t make long-term sense.

When you have a good stock which is tanking because of non-financial reasons, holding it is an advantage. By selling it, you give up your advantage.

No company is so good that it is worth any cost. You can buy a good, quality pair of shoes at a reasonable price, upwards of $100 even! But paying $10,000 for a pair of shoes — even designer — can’t be called a good investment. Apple may make good products, but its price may not justify investment.

The key to value investing is getting a bargain price. Private equity and startup investors get access to amazing deals, but the risk is greater because there’s no margin of safety. There’s less financial analysis to be done and more emphasis on determining growth rate, which is inherently more subjective and speculative.

Imagine if interest rates dropped for mortgage loans. Would you sell your home? What if the value dropped on Redfin or Zillow? Then why would you sell a stock just because the price dropped?

The stock market disproves the idea that an individual can only get wealthy by luck. The character traits of long term successful investors are character traits for successful wealthy people in all industries: believe in your foundation, stay disciplined, and listen to your brain not your ego. Entrprenuers buy massive amounts of stock when it is its most affordable — it costs $0. They do the legwork to make it grow.

# Chapter 9

Financial instruments are commodities. Paying high prices for them make no sense (or cents). Money managers charging high fees are like designer goods. Not practically worth it, but good if you want to flex on your neighbors.

Good funds have similar qualities:

1. Managed by founders and employees who are invested in the plan, and hopefully mostly.
2. Low fees (because they’re paying them too)
3. It closes itself from asset elephantiasis (growing too large)
4. Monomial transactions to reduce fees, opex, and taxes

When evaluating funds, known risks > unknown risks > known gains

# Chapter 10

Be careful about financial advisors. Look for advisors to keep you on the straight and plain path, not lead you to the exotic offshore one.

# Chapter 11

Math is used for forecasting but it is extremely sensitive. A 1% error can dramatically alter the value of an investment. Graham suggests that nothing beyond basic algebra is necessary, which makes sense because accounting is basic algebra. Addition and subtraction, with a bit of multiplication and division for finding ratios. Complex math can be seen as a marketing tool, by sttempting to associate something precise with something speculative.

Put simply, a good value-investment is paying 80 cents (or less!) for a dollar.

# Chapter 13

The price of a stock should be no more than 1.5 net asset value and no more than 15x the average earnings for last three years.

# Chapter 14

Useful Ratios:

- Current assets should be >= 2x current liabilities
- Net current assets > long term liabilitirs
- Price to book value ratio should be less than or equal to 1.5

Efficient market hypothesis can’t be perfect because of human temperaments and conflicts of interest. Because people react to the stock price, changes in the stock reflect a portion of irrationality, which funds can manipulate with artificial demand. Flat rate fees and blind pricing are how to achieve efficient market hypothesis.

# Chapter 15

52 week lows are great starting point to find bargains because they may be low due to popularity

Return on owners invested capital should be 10%+

# Chapter 16

Convertible shares are less risky than the stock because of a higher position on the bankruptcy totem pole, but in practice it’s not a worthwhile buy. Consider a hypothetical in which you approach an intersection of 3 roads: the first has no issues, the second results in you getting mauled by a bear, and the third has you getting mauled by 2 bears. Road 2 is strictly better than road 3, but it is irrelevant because you would never choose it if you had option 1. Convertibles offer worse returns than stock in bull markets and worse returns than bonds in bear markets, so when exactly would you want to buy it?

# Chapter 17

Acquisitions are like people flexing. It doesn’t mean you’re smart or important, but actually can indicate laziness and incompetence. Why does a person need a $500 wallet? Why does a company need to pay a billion dollars to acquire a product someone else built?Occasionally, there are great reasons for an acquisition, but if that’s where the majority of growth is coming from, it’s a managerial problem.

# Chapter 18

Intelligent Investor Maxim: There are good companies and bad companies, but no such thing as a good or bad stock. Only a well priced stock.

- Bad companies are bad investments at _any_ price
- Good companies are bad investments at _beyond_ a certain a price

Complex capital structures make it difficult for investors to accurately value the company. Keep it simple — spend less on accountants.

There are always good bargains, you just need to be disciplined and find them.

# Chapter 19

3% of IPOs in 2000 paid dividends. 72% of IPOs in 1968 did. Maybe wealth is drying up because investments aren’t returning as much or investors are acting less fiscally responsible?

Stockholders are the boss. As an investor, think of it as _your_ company, _your_ assets, _your_ CEO. They answer to you. If they want to keep the money, they better damn well produce capital gains.

Diversification does nothing if you overpay for every stock.

Rich people have a streak of not losing over long periods of time. The compound effects keep them ahead of others and enable them to take advantage of market folly.

Trying not to lose is a lot less fun than trying to win. This is probably why so few people are actually intelligent investors, and why so few people are actually rich. Because the behaviors one has when they are trying not to lose leads them to be very cautious and conservative in other facets of their life. For instance there is no way an intelligent investor could gamble in a casino with the expectation of earning money. They may gamble for entertainment but they would look at their money not as a way to earn capital but in the same way that they would go to a theater and pay for popcorn. Viewed in this way, intelligent investors do not select stocks most effectively, they manage risk most effectively.
