### A First Principles Approach to Money

- something is valuable when it is scarce
- time is valuable because it is scarce
- time's value is amplified because the quantity is unknown
- Time can be exchanged for anything, but nothing can be exchanged for time
- You can, however, exchange your time for someone else's time
  - this is how you gain effective time
- Time's value is relative and changing. IT does not remain fixed, it is dependent on the population in a given region, and the potential ability of that population.

Other ways:

- Maximize expected return, not nominal
  Lottery versus a salary
- learn from other's mistakes
  - read -- faster than audio and denser than visual
- help yourself before you help others
  - Airline Oxygen mask rule

## Alone in wilderness

Limited time. You don't know how long you can live. You have to exchange time for whatever u want.

years to fashion tools to gather materials to construct a house. While taking breaks to get your hunting gear and go hunt. Lets say doing this takes 1 year to build a house.
No one to trade with, no one to buy from, no one to kill and steal from. No one to tax. You have to do it yourself

## Add another person

Both of you could learn to hunt, learn to gather, learn to fashion tools and source materials and construct a home. But that's a lot of duplicated effort. It'd be more efficient if you could focus on learning the most optimal way to build a home, and your neighbor focused on gathering food. Being able to focus has several benefits:

- Cognitive gains from not context switching
- Time gains as you become more proficient and experienced

Let's say with your focus, you could build 2 homes in a year. Now, you don't need 2 homes, so you could trade that second house for all the food you need for the year.

This introduces the concept of trade, where people are better off specializing in a trade and exchanging the fruits of their labor with someone who is specialized in whatever it is that you want. In this way, both people are better off because they have more time than they would have had if they weren't able to trade. I call this relative gain in time effective time, because you don't necessarily know how long it would take you to do it yourself, you don't know how much time you have, so you don't know how much time you're saving, but you know that you're saving a non-zero amount of time.

Trade has some other hidden benefits, namely in safety. Because I'm better off trading with you, I have less of an incentive to hurt you, since you can't work as effectively at gathering food when you're injured, which means I'll have less food available to me. I also don't have an incentive to steal from you, because not only does that make you less likely to trade with me, it distracts me from my specailty and makes gives me less to trade.

## Town

More people more ways to specialize. Trade is good, but we run into some logistical problems.
Firstly, trade limits me to only trading what people who want what I have at this moment. And since they are also limited by what I want at this moment, the potentail pool of people to trade with is fairly small.

To manage this, the town organizes multi-way trades to help people find other people to trade with. I have a rock and want paper, I find a papermaker who wants scissors, and I find a scissorsmith who wants a rock.

I trade my rock to the scissorsmith for his scissors, and I trade the scissors with the paper maker for his paper. Rock-Paper-Scissors.

But this is convoluted, and still limited in that it requires us to all trade something we made in the past for something at the present time. What if I wanted to trade for something in the future? For instance, what if i have a bountiful harvest which will rot if I don't trade it? How can i store the value of my work to use in the future?

To solve this, the town made coins
