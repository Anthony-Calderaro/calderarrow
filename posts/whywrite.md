## Why Write?

The first time I used a word processor was in the first grade to write an essay on the [eight key concepts](https://fivemoodovalues.wordpress.com/philosophy/eight-key-concepts/) of the local martial arts studio I attended. I was a poor typist, but I liked how adaptive the medium was compared to pen and pencil. Mistakes could be instantaneously corrected and all of my tools were always available, eliminating the need for highlighters, white-out, ink, or sharpeners. I felt like I could focus more on writing instead of preparing to write.

My handwriting ~was~ is atrocious. The biggest benefit was that I could reliably read what I had previously typed. Whenever I wrote something I would need later on, I would spend so much effort writing legibly that it became laborious. Typing was legible, adaptive, and most importantly, durable, giving me immunuity to staining, ripping, and misplacement.

I maintained a journal in one form or another for most of my childhood, but I stopped writing regularly around 11th grade. I was more interested in reading, sports, and enjoying the fleeting years of high school with my friends. I also wasn’t that interesting. At 27 years old, I’m still not that interesting. So why get back into writing?

Around the time I turned 20, I started to really hone in on my [life’s purpose](/purpose). In 2019, my [grandpa passed away](/grandpa). There was so much I still didn’t know about him and so much I felt he wanted to share. My great-grandfather passed away when in his early 50s before he could meet my dad. I only have pictures of him. What was he like? What was it like growing up like he did? Should I be so fortunate to one day become a father, I want to be the best I can be. And that means planning for the worst. If I die young, how could I mitigate the damage? I could buy life insurance so my family is financially stable, but financial wellbeing is only one facet of the [cura personalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura_personalis). My wife might be happy to finally have some peace and quiet, but my kids would miss out on conversations with dad. I wouldn’t be able to teach them what I want to teach them – and worse, they wouldn’t be able to learn from my mistakes. My relatives won't be able to answer those questions, but maybe I can answer them for my kids.

Journaling may be a way to achieve this. Randy Pauch inspired this idea with his [last lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo) which I remember watching as a senior in high school but never considered implementing myself until recently. I don’t want to become a professional writer nor monetize a blog. I don’t want to convince the world that X is right and Y is wrong. I don’t want to tell people what to do, how to act, or who to be. I just want to talk with my kids.

I thought about making voice or video recordings, but I realized I would end up transcribing them later. I figured it would be faster to just write the transcription and skip the recording. Writing can be done silently, requires less equipment, and people read faster than they listen, so it seems like a more effective medium for what I'm trying to accomplish.

### Writing in Public

If I'm interested in chatting with my kids, why write publicly? Good question. I considered writing privately, and just giving my kids a usb or cloud repository with a bunch of word documents for them to read, but decided against it.

At the risk of sounding self-absorbed, I may have a useful nugget of insight every now and then. If so, I’d like to share it with as many people as possible, not just my kids. I learned a lot from people who wrote things and made them freely available. If I can pay it forward, I should.

The selfish reason to write publicly is that there is a lot that I do not know, and this medium is a great way to get answers to questions I care about. It’s easy to shout into the void in social media and get downvoted into oblivion without intelligent respones. Writing a journal entry seems more intimate. I can develop a relationship with the reader and focus on the topic at hand. This allows us to have lengthy conversations without interruption, advertisements, or hot takes. If I need a particularly quick answer, I can take advantage of [Cunningham’s law](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law). And by laying this out in a meta-post, I may be able to garner get some sympathy for the assinine things I eventually write.

Maybe.

### Writing for my family

The most important reason for using this medium is accessibility. Every single essay I write is addressed to my kids, and I want them to be able to easily reference these ideas, writings, and lessons. Everything is laid out, time stamped categorized, and available 24/7. In the event that they want to build on it, the code is also available in a [repository](https://github.com/Anthony-Calderaro/calderarrow) for their use. Maybe one day my kids or grandkids will add their thoughts and this project will turn into a multi-generational time-capsule. That'd be cool.

My decision to document this for my family is a choice which will inadvertantly be reflected in my tone and vernacular. When I say _you_, I'm referring to my family. My hope is that it feels more like a conversation with their dad than reading an essay written by an eccentric milenial.

Ultimately, the goal is for them to have a better life than me. That’s the metric I will use to guage my success as a parent. It's my KPI. My north star.
