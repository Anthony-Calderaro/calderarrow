# Awareness v Action

Building awareness seems to be a popularly accepted noble/charitable cause. Person learns about an injustic, and tells people in their network about it, with the hope that their friends/family share the word and help the cause.

But what seems to happen more often is everyone just shares the word but doesn't do anything to actually help. This is bad for 2 reasons:

1. It doesn't actually help the cause
2. It makes people feel like they're helping the cause, which may deter them from actually doing things to help the cause.
