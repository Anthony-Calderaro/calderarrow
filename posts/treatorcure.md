### To Treat or To Cure

Treat or Cure, because resources are limited 
Could do one as effectively as possible, or both less-effectively
Decision can be driven by external (cost, availability, awarenss) or internal (personal experience, family/friend, limited finances)
People and organizations try to do this.
Difficulty with giving and charity is the ability to reasonably compare two options.
Look at a few metrics in the form 990: executive comp (page X), functional expenses, Salary expense/employee.
Assuming all else is equal, it's driven by preference. Some want 100-0, some want 50-50, some want 0-0.
We could force people to give a certain way, or force them to give in general. Few problems:
  1. What if they really don't agree with it?
  2. What if the cost of enforcement is greater than the funds received/distributed?
    - would have been better off not enforcing it, and spending the enforcement funds on the problem instead.
Goal: 
As of writing this, i fall more into the "cure" side of things. That doesn't mean people more on the "treat" side of things are worse, or that im better. It's just different. Vanilla to chocolate. Red to bLue.
But it's not hard to see how something like this can become hyper polarized, especially when people have personal attachments to their side. Of course they're more likely to want to treat cancer patients if their mother died of cancer. They'd probably be mad at someone for suggesting no money go towards treatment, and all goes towards research -- or even worse -- researching a totally unreleated cure.

It's important to prioritize. People are bad at it -- and worse at comparing and prioritizing things in the future, especially compared to present. 
It's important to 
As a society, we have to, as an individual, we should. Many of our decisions can be considered in this light. Will doing X treat or cure my problem? Is my problem physical, like obesdiety? Psycological, like Depression? Financial?
Treatments are oftentimes quicker, easier, and more financially accessible. that does not mean they are financially superior. 
The financial cost of taking pain medication every day may beworth it compared to a 40k surgery that isn't life threatening. But what about the cost of not taking an extra drink? Of buckling up before driving? Of buying off-brand clothing? [Every decision is a financial decision](), 


There are dozens of ways to divvy up the funds, but no approach can be made until you can compare and _rank_ the endeavors. This is ridiculously difficult for an individual, so in a democratic system of millions of people, it’s nearly impossible. Nothing would get done.

Decision to treat or cure is often due to economic reasons. 100k surgery or .10 pain killer I can get while food shopping.

Government tries to address this, both directly through public health research, and indirectly through economic incentives. Tax rebates, credits, patents.

There’s no threshold when one should start treating instead of curing or vice versa. You could suggest that the lifetime value of creating a cure over centuries of humanity will result in the largest number of life saves, but that comes at a cost which is that a certain number of people dealing with that issue right now have to suffer. What is the time value of suffering?

So it largely comes down to personal preference personal resources and personal priorities. Someone who is poor may not donate money to charities that relieve pain because they strongly believe that curing is the best long-term goal and therefore if they had money they would exclusively donate to organizations focused on cures. Similarly, a wealthy person with ample financial resources might say that the future value of people who may or may not exist with a condition or not worth the suffering of present humans, and exclusively donate to organizations that diagnose or treat.


Some organizations do a mixture of both, although they aren’t as good at one or the other. Hospitals often have a treatment plan that they implement over a long period of time, while also allowing patients to enroll in research or experimental programs to drive innovation forward.

But for a lot of non-medical issues the divide becomes much sharper. Do we invest in building houses for the homeless or do we give that money to the homeless to move into existing houses? Do we invest in agricultural developments which make food easier and more cost-effective to grow? Or do we spend that money on buying food for those who are hungry. These aren’t yes no black white right wrong kind of questions, their preferences. 

For me I think that I try to give where I can

Single most important thing in my opinion, is to follow the airplane rule you have to get yourself situated before you try to help others. When the oxygen masks deploy you put your mask on first before you help your neighbor even if it’s your kid your mom your dad your uncle. Once you are on solid ground, once you have a foundation, then you may help others

So generally speaking I would prioritize paying down one’s debts , Getting to a stable financial livelihood and accomplishing all of your life‘s immediate needs. Well it’s admirable to donate when you are poor, I’d much rather see people invest that money and getting themselves situated said they are no longer in need of charity down the road.

So instead of collecting taxes and dealing with the beurocracy of appropriating and distributing funds, the government subsidizes charity by not taxing earnings which go towards charity. And it isn’t a $1 donated = $1 in taxes, the benefit is [BELOW the line](), so it’s according to the marginal tax rate. A billionaire is getting 40 cents on the dollar-donated, which is nominally more than the lower income brackets, but that’s a consequence of progressive tax systems, not some conspiracy to keep the 1% rich. 

The benefit of this is that it’s also my localized, dynamic, and can be more efficient. Instead of beurocrats at a state capital deciding who gets what, individuals can mobilize and distribute funds in their immediate community as needed. Grants can be issued across state lines, and the process of charity is freed from the shackles of political gridlock. Imagine if the majority of an electorate decided to exclusively fund charitable purposes in the majority’s community, and completely ignore the minority’s communities. 

The obvious downside is that people may donate to “less important” causes. This is obviously subjective, but it can’t result in some unfortunate abuses. A more insidious downside is that People could donate to a private foundation which donates funds to researching a cure in a biotech company owned by the same individual. Or that same foundation employing lots of family members and paying them huge salaries.
