### Happiness and Happy Distractions

July 2021

Recently, I've realized that there are 2 types of happiness. The first is a pure sense of happiness. It is the enjoyment of doing something you love, or spending time with someone you love. I feel it when my runner's high kicks in, when I get into a state of flow while programming, or on lazy Sunday afternoons when I'm cuddling with my wife. If I could, I would spend my entire life doing these things, but I can't for one reason or the other. I can only run for so long before my body gives out. My wife will eventually want to eat. 

When I'm not doing these activities, my life is mostly comprised of activities which support these happy-activities. While I'd love to spend 40 hours a week Monday thru Friday drinking espresso, working out, coding, and spending time with my wife, I want to make sure that we have shelter, food, and other essentials, so I work. 

I'm fortunate in that I'm able to work in an occupation which makes me happy more ofthen than not. Most people aren't so lucky. But even still, my day job is not the most enjoyable thing in my life, rather, it enables me to pursue happiness outside of working hours.

For most of my childhood, and even most of my early adult years, my out-of-school/work time was spent immersed in video games. I'm hesistant to use the word addiction, but I was compulsively engaging in video games despite adverse consequences to my emotional, physical, and social wellbeing. 

Games can be innocuous. Getting together with friends to play card or board games or watch movies on a Friday night makes me happy. But when you immerse yourself in an activity which was only pursued as a distraction, the end result is bad.

I played games because we moved as a kid, and games allowed me to 1) easily connect with new friends via a common interest, 2) stay in contact with friends who were geographically inaccessible, 3) were intellectually stimulating, and 4) distracted me from boredom.

That fourth item is the most important. I held a false dichotomy where I felt like boredom was the only possible alternative from a happy distraction. It took me a while to discover that I could fill that void with activities that actually brought me happiness. 

I imagine smokers experience a similar realization when they've successfully quit. They realize that smoking never actually gave them joy, it was just a distraction from a chore or responsibility, a temporary stimulant when feeling down, or a crutch relied on for personal happiness. I would procrastinate on school with video games. If I had a bad day, I would log on and try to accomplish something in game to lift my spirits. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I was [laid off](/writings/), which left me with a lot more time. When I found a new job, my employer was remote, so I still had the additional time I didn't spend commuting, plus the down time when work was slow. I filled the void with video games. I had all these goals for my characters to achieve, complete with daily and weekly tasks and checkpoints to reach. 

I stopped running as much, i stopped eating as healthy. Worst of all, I spent less and less time with my Wife -- my best friend. My life partner. 

The problem with video games is that 1) there is no auto-stop mechanism. If I run 10 miles then try to play a game of pick up basketball, my body will tell me to stop, one way or the other. With video games, you can play much longer because it isn't as physically demanding. Worst of all, switching between games is trivial, so when failsafes do kick in -- boredom, completion of daily objectives -- you can switch to the next game. That's what I would do. 

In fact, I don't know how I would have snapped out of it had it not been by chance. My wife had expressed a dislike in how much i spent playing games, but like any addict, I brushed her concerns aside. We had recently been doing some reorganizing of things in our house. We were trying to get rid of excessive items, and we noticed that we had a lot of books which we really didn't need. We wanted to donate them, but I wanted to try to read every book once more before getting an e-version and donating the physical copy.

One of the books on my shelf was actually a book i had never read, the Road by Cormac McCarthy. I bought it a few years back in the airport when going home from school, but never got around to it. I started reading one day, and a few weeks later, I finished.

I finished one night when I was up until about midnight playing a game, having just spent the past 12 hours of the day playing, I was so frustrated that I had to take a break. I was wired, so I decided to finish the book. Without offering any spoilers, the final chapters of The Road made me so emotional. I re read them at least a dozen times that night. 

I couldn't stop thinking about my future children. Is this really how I would want to have spent my final moments with them? What about my wife? If this was my final day, is this how I would have chosen my day? 12 Hours on a computer, away from my love? No. Video games were something I used to fill the void until I discovered activities which brought me happiness. Games distracted me from unhappiness, like rescheduling a dentist appointment to get your tooth fixed.

This wasn't a new idea, but I had to come to it on my own. I'm reminded of [Allen Carr's The_Easy_Way_to_Stop_Smoking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Easy_Way_to_Stop_Smoking), of which 90-something-percent of the book is spent convincing the reader that smoking is not only beneficial for your life, but that it actively harms it and you don't need to smoke, before using the final pages telling you that all you need to do to stop smoking is to stop smoking. I can't validate whether this works or not, but I could understand some of its merit. Addicition is a partly psychological, partly biological condition. Video game addiction is mostly psychological, and stopping video games is as biologically easy as clicking the power-off button. The psycological withdrawls of having to deal with boredom and idleness are the larger obstacles, but for me, I had none. I just needed to realize it for myself. By logging off and unsubscribing, I was cured.

That's not to say I never play games. In the same way that playing poker with friends doesn't make me a gambling addict, getting together to play Mario Kart or Halo don't make me addicted to video games. The difference is I no longer use video games to distract me from my life. I no longer base my self-worth on virtual achievements. I no longer think or plan about games in advance, I play them for the duration of the game, and when the game ends, so does its hold on my attention. 

but in the same way that an addict can't have just one drink of alcohol, I can't go back to certain types of games. I can't go back to games which take more than a couple of days to complete. MMORPGs are strictly off-limits, especially those which actively develop new features, as they can suck me into a virtual world where I could stay forever.

Quitting was a lot easier too once I came to this conclusion. I remember logging off, unsubscribing, and deleting the spreadsheets, documents, and journals containing notes, plans, and ideas I had for my characters. A few months later and I still catch myself caught up in the saddness of it all. How many years of my life had I wasted? Years which I'll never get back. I've been able to keep in contact with the friends I made through other channels, and I'm amazed with the sheer amount of time I have to appreciate life. I've been able to read more, work out more, and I've even picked up writing, as you can see here. Most importantly, I have more time to spend with my wife. All of these are activities which make me happy. Not happy that I can get a distraction from whatever chores or boredom I have in my life. Pure happiness. And you know what's best of all?

It's real.
