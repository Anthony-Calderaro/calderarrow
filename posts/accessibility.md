Accessibility is the way.

This page is designed to be as simple and accessible as possible, accounting for the fact that I am a poor designer.
Basic fonts on whatever device you have.
Light theme is black/white/blue, dark theme is black/white/light blue

Lighthouse scores are maxxed out
I use eslinter and ally
Everything can be navigated with keyboard only

I haven't tested using voice commands, but drop me a note if there's anything missing.
