- REsponsible for personal development
- Wasn't allowed to play xbox/ps. Parents like the family-friendly-ness of ninetendo, and liked that they could play along as well.

- Most deal with making optimal decisions with limited resources (energy, mana, money, time)

- Pokemon taught me a lot about math. Is 10+10 better than 10x2? Generally. Is 10+10 better than 10x 3? Maybe, maybe not.

  - speaking of playing along, woke up from a nap and saw my mom and dad learning to play with the starter decks downstairs. Super cute, wholesome memory.

- Age of mythology, strategy in real time, adapting and changing, managing resources and limitations

  - norse egyption and greek mythology. Fascination with Norse would eventually lead me to learn more about Denmark, and from there, Kierkegarde.
  - Egyption mythology inspired me to learn more about Africa and the middle east at a young age, with a reverence for the culture rather than through the lens of destruction and turmoil
  - Greek mythology led me to roman studies, reconnected with my ancestry.

- Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal: Underground Area with 3 locks, i couldn't figure it out (because i wasn't being methodical) and met someone at a martial art tournament who showed me how to win. I love Ohioans!

- Runescape was a way for our friends ot hang out after school. Buying GF, 10k.

- Led the way for other games: Pokemon TCG led to Yugioh which got me through elementary and middle school. Met kids who played MTG at summer camp, which i played in HS.

RTS led me to Wc3, which led me to World of Warcraft in High School. Remember going to the school library in between periods to look up Tier 2 rogue sets on [Thotbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thottbot) with my good friend Mike. My first character was a troll rogue.
