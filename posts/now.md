## Now

This is my [Now Page](), inspired by Dan Sivirs now page. In addition to being a conscice way to communicate my actions and allocations, it serves as a timeline of my priorities &mdash; and a reference to my future self from my past self. 

To provide structure and consistency, I try to always include an update on what I'm doing professionally, academically, civicly, technically, athletically, musically, leisurely, and personally.

### Q1 2022

Professionally, I'm starting to finally feel adjusted to my role at Capital One which I started in March. We are working remotely until they decide otherwise, but some of their building ammenities are open, and the gym is an undervalued perk during COVID times. Capital One has embraced the [YBIYOI](https://www.wikipedia.org/ybiyoi) mantra, so we work in highly distributed teams and own everything from the development, maintainence, testing, and monitoring. It's a great learning opportunity, especially because they've gone all-in on cloud computing, both culturally and financially, so we have the support and resources needed to build and scale at will. For such a large financial organization, our teams are incredibly agile and autonomous.

Academically, I will be taking advantage of Capital One's tuition benefits to pursue a Master's degree in computer science. I've been lacking a technical, academic background in this field, so I'm looking forward to rounding out my hands-on programming skills with a deeper understanding of the underlying tools and technologies. Because my other degrees are in accounting, I need to take some more technical prerequsites at the local community college, and classes start in January.

Civicly, I just completed a volunteer EMT course offered through my county and became a licensed EMT. This is a prerequisite to enroll in firefighter school, which I'd like to do sometime in 2023. I had to miss [Operation Santa]() this year because we're doing Christmas with my parents, but next year I may be able to ride along as an elf.

Technically, I’ve been tinkering with an idea for a search engine which completely excludes sites with advertisements by default. I may try to build something in Puppeteer which leverages headless chrome and the Network Dev Tools so I can intercept requests to common ad networks or cross reference the request against ad-block filters listed on extensions like [ublock origin](ublockorigin.com). Friendly reminder that if you're not using ublock origin, please [install it](). It's both free and freeing.

Athletically, I’ve started working out at Capital One's gym now in addition to running. I haven't seriously lifted since high school, so I'm slowly getting back into things. I'm hoping that the weight training helps me break a 20'00" 5km, a 5'32" 1600m, and a 2'15" 800m in 2022. And if I could end the year squatting at least my body weight, that would be money in the bank.

Musically, I'm planning on learning piano. My girlfriend-at-the-time-who-is-now-my-wife got me a keyboard as a graduation present which has been collecting dust over the past few years. I've been assembling a playlist of songs I'd like to cover, so if I can end 2022 playing a decent job of Vanessa Carlton's Thousand Miles, I'd consider it a success.

Leisurely, I’m going to be playing in the Old School RuneScape Shattered Relic Leagues event in January. Theorycrafting this game mode has been exciting and addicting. I also just purchased a year's membership using in-game currency, which is terrible finanically, but somehow registers as a massive dopaine hit in my brain. In 2021 I started overcoming an unhealthy relationship with video games, and Runescape has been quite helpful.

Personally, my fingers are crossed that my wife and I will be able to go on our honeymoon which had been postponed twice due to COVID. The Omnicron varient is starting to take off, so at this rate we'll be taking our honeymoon when we retire.
