# What I'm Doing Now: Q4 2021
Professionally, I'm starting to finally feel adjusted to my role at Capital One which I started back in March. We are indefinitely remote until they decide otherwise, but their headquarters are open on certain days. Their buildings are beautiful, massive, and the gym is a nice perk during COVID times. I've wanted to get [into fintech](journey to fintech) for several years now, so being able to work at such a large scale is amazing.

Academically, I’ll be taking advantage of Capital One's tuition benefits to pursue a Master's degree in software engineering. I've been lacking a technical, academic background in computer science, so I'm looking forward to the coursework. Because my other degrees are in accounting, I need to take some more technical prerequsites at the local community college, and my classes start in January.

Civicly, I just completed a volunteer EMT course offered through my county, which is a prerequisite to enroll in firefighter school. Once I receive approval from my county, I'll be eligible to take the National EMT exam, offering me yet another backup career should I lose my competency as an engineer and/or accountant. Once I get my certification, I'll be able to volunteer at the local fire station in their ambulance, medic, and fire supression apparatus. I am missing [Operation Santa]() this year because we're doing Christmas with my parents, but next year I may be able to ride as an elf.

Technically, I’ve been tinkering with an idea for a search engine which completely excludes sites with advertisements by default. I may try to build something in Puppeteer which leverages headless chrome and the Network Dev Tools so I can intercept requests to common ad networks or cross reference the request against ad-block filters listed on extensions like [ublock origin](ublockorigin.com). Friendly reminder that if you're not using ublock origin, please [install it](). It's both free and freeing.

Athletically, I’ve started working out at Capital One's gym now in addition to running. I haven't seriously lifted since high school, so I'm slowly getting back into things. I'm hoping that the weight training helps me break a 20'00" 5km, a 5'32" 1600m, and a 2'15" 800m in 2022. If I could end the year squatting at least my body weight, that would be icing on the cake.

Musically, I'm planning on learning piano after the holidays. My girlfriend-at-the-time-who-is-now-my-wife got me a keyboard as a graduation present which has been collecting dust over the past few years. I've been assembling a playlist of songs I'd like to cover, so if I can end 2022 playing a decent job of Vanessa Carlton's Thousand Miles, I'd consider it a success.

Leisurely, I’m going to be playing in the Old School RuneScape Shattered Relic Leagues event in January. Theorycrafting this game mode has been exciting and addicting. I also just purchased a year's membership using in-game currency, which is terrible finanically, but somehow registers as a massive dopaine hit in my brain.

Personally, my fingers are crossed that my wife and I will be able to go on our honeymoon which had been postponed twice due to COVID. The Omnicron varient is starting to take off, so at this rate we'll be taking our honeymoon when we retire.
