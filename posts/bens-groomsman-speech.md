## Ben Malin's Groomsman Speech

Below is the speech Ben had written for Lilia and me on our wedding day. Because of the bridal party pairings, he couldn't give it live during the wedding, but he sent me the speech afterwards and gave us a private rendition.

> Hi, everyone. I’m Ben, Anthony’s awful roommate from freshman year turned friend turned awesome post-college roommate. This is going to have a lot of inside jokes, so I’m sorry for the 95% of you who don’t understand any of this, but please laugh anyway so I can feel like this is going well. Speaking of, Kevin, those legs are looking extra skinny. Don’t skip leg day.

> When I met Anthony Calderaro ten years ago, my immature 18-year-old self thought he was so annoying. Why does he always ask where I’m heading? Why does he call me late at night to check where I am? Why does he choose to play this sub-optimal Mage build in World of Warcraft? Why would he say that Shane’s too strong? Sorry again to the 95% of you.

> When I first met Lilia in person sometime later, I thought “she’s taller than I expected!”

> In the time leading up to that first meeting with Lilia, I got to listen to Anthony tell her how much he loved her EVERY SINGLE NIGHT and begin to meticulously plan with her their wedding. They’d only been dating for a month or so when that started. Young love, amirite?

> It looks like all that planning worked out and those soulbearing I love yous were the real deal.

> If you know Anthony and Lilia well, you’ve probably observed how different they are. Anthony, the quiet, passive man who doesn’t seem to be phased by anything. Lilia, the thunderously vocal woman who is never afraid to speak her mind. I won’t insert a cliché about how opposite attract and all that jazz. But instead, I want to acknowledge that each of their personalities has helped the other become the best possible man and woman they could be. Anthony is now more compassionate and stands up for himself more than I ever expected of him, and Lilia can take any adversity thrown at her in stride, finding the most logical solution for every situation. But let’s be real, Lilia is still the #1 most likely person to call out some BS when she sees it.

> This ends with a sweet sentiment, but there are few boxes I’d like to check off before wrapping up.

> 1. I have a hilarious series of selfies Lilia sent me when she got her wisdom teeth out that I wasn’t allowed to turn into a slideshow for the wedding. Hit me up if you want to see.

> 2. Anthony, you still owe me a t-shirt.

> 3. Lilia, your eyebrows look great. Filled in PERFECTLY.

> 4. Anthony, cargo shorts still aren’t cool.

> 5. Lilia, I know you really wanted Luna the dog here, but she sends her congratulations and is simultaneously upset that you’re taking away her one true love.

> 6. One time we were playing Settlers of Catan and Anthony shaved the ends of his eyebrows so they were squared off. Lilia still married him. That’s true love.

> What I didn’t understand ten years ago and what I fully grasp now is that Anthony cares, maybe not about the most optimal class builds in World of Warcraft, but definitely about the people in his life. Lilia, you couldn’t be luckier to be married to someone who even at 18 cared enough about a practical stranger to call him when he was out super late to make sure he was okay. You have a partner who will always be there when you need him and will always make sure you’re okay. I don’t really need to wish you two luck because it’s already been a year and marriage is going great for you. So instead, keep it up! I love you both.
