## To Kevin and Danielle

Below is the speech I had written for Kevin and Danielle, two of my closest and oldest friends, on their wedding day.

> Hi everyone, sorry about the delay. I didn’t mean to make you wait. But hey, what’s a few more minutes after 12 years, right Danielle?

> For those of you I haven’t met, My name is Anthony. Over the years, I’ve gone by a number of names: AJ, Ant, Mr. Moneybags. But for a small group of friends from grade school, I’m Tony.

> Kevin is one of those friends. I met Kevin back in middle school, and one of the earliest memories I have is Spanish class with our favorite teacher, Senior Phillips. Senior Phillips would regularly give Kevin useful life advice, but I’ll never forget his most common lesson: don’t be annoying.

> It is a lesson Kevin is still learning to this day.

> I love Kevin. But I’ll be the first to tell you that he takes a long time to do things. Whether it’s getting married or taking his turn in Settlers of Cataan, Kevin acts as if every decision is the last decision he’ll ever make. Buddy, I can assure u that there will be plenty more games of Cataan — but this better be the only wedding!

> As a groomsmen, I felt it was my job to make sure Kevin arrived on time to his special day, which is why I told him it started at 5 last night. Amazingly, he still managed to show up late today.

> But you know what? No matter how late he is, he will &ndash; eventually &ndash; show up. I may never know when Kevin will arrive, but one thing I know for certain is that Kevin will always show up.

> Usually people need to be counseled against getting married too quickly. You guys must have spoken with a whole lot of counselors.

> In truth, I wish more people took their time with relationships. It’s been a delight to watch you both grow together and individually. Over this time, You’ve learned how to work together, how to live together, and you compliment each other extremely well. Danielle is calm, cool and collected. Kevin, less so. Danielle has a tremendous amount of patience, and Kevin requires a lot of patience. And Danielle is an actual doctor while Kevin is…good with computers? Just kidding.
> But it’s not just the complimentary aspects that make your relationship work, it’s the unwavering commitment you have to a common set of uncommon values. You foster each other’s ambition without tempering your own. You care and encourage one another without over-indulging. And your rigorous self discipline serves as an example and a reminder that more is not only possible, it is expected. But what I think stands out the most is the fierce loyalty you devote to each other, and to those you treasure. These traits made you ideal partners for the journey you began together many years ago, and they will sustain you through the many years to come.

> When you do encounter hardships, reflect on where you started, and the millions of moments which brought you so far. Remember the people in this room, who love you unconditionally and made every effort to be here so they could witness the start of a new chapter in your unfolding saga. They came from far and wide to support you, to celebrate you, and to be inspired by you. Your relationship carries the collective hope that we hold in our hearts. Hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a life filled with love, and hope in happily ever afters.

> I cannot promise you that marriage will be easy, but I promise you it will be worth it. Life is the greatest adventure of all, and in each other, you’ve found someone to share in its endless joys.

> To Kevin and Danielle.
