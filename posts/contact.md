## Contact

Generally speaking, email is the best way to reach me. I avoid social media as much as possible. It's the modern day cigarette.

Email is simple, ubiquitous, and asynchronous. If you want to chat, consider this an open invitation to reach out to me at my student email address going strong since 2011: Anthonyj@gwu.edu.
