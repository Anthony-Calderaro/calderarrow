### Test

After college, I started working in public accounting which was a phenomenal job for a [number of reasons](link). After a few years, patterns began to emerge when performing similar tasks across different clients, and I believed I could automate some of them. At the time, the scope of work I believed could be automated was small enough that I could do myself, so I set out to learn enough programming to make me more efficient.
