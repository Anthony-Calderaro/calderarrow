### The browser as a search engine

1. Using the browser as a search engine
- DDG bangs are the real deal, allowing you to have the ultimate experience -- searching exactly what you want exactly where u want. No ads needed, no tracking needed, other than your IP and your search info.

2. Barriers to adoption
- People think they want flexibility of searching everything. 
Really? How often a week do you search for something and you _don't already know which site you're looking for_. You can tell if you do by looking at some of your searches. For instance, would you search for $movie reviews, or $movie reviews rotten tomatoes. If it's the latter, you don't need a search engine -- google, bing, or DDG.

3. Bang, Sleep, Repeat
Excuse the euphemism, but I wanted to make sure you're engaged. 
Popular bangs
- !w  "I want to learn more about this person/place/thing
- !so "How to change the color of console log text."
- !nyt "Did the NYT discover anything new about ${topic}"
- !osrs "How do I make money in oldschool runescape?"
- !yt "I want to watch videos of cute animals"
- !gm "Where can I get Indian food?"



4. Headfake: You don't need Google.
That's a clickbaity subheader. More specifically, you don't need google search as often as you think you do. I make a few hundred searches each week across my devices, and catch myself using !g less than once on average. But that's just me. Most of the complaints I hear from ardent google-searchers is about the quality of the search results, but when you're going through the search results, you're doing the filtering of which site is the one you want. This approach has you do that work up front. The cost is that you may be wrong and have to make a duplicate search (which is the same cost of using any search engine), but you benefit by having a materially faster experience.  

Most importantly, you avoid ads and help fight against the pervasive surveilance culture of $BIGTECH.Just kidding, i know you don't give a shit about privacy. But I know that you value your time, and this method lets you save yourself time. So try it out.
