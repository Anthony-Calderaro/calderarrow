In [elementary school](https://pioneer.djusd.net/home), we had computer class a few times each week where we had the opportunity to explore the computer relatively unsupervised. Classes would begin with a brief introductory idea or concept, and the remainder of the class was free to us. We were limited by the software already installed, and the internet had a firewall, but most of the class was spent experimenting with the device.

One of my favorite things to do was play around in Microsoft Powerpoint.

- Hardware Stores
- wholesalers
- Aisles and Rows with multiple levels
- Reminds me of 3D spreadsheets
  How to the items relate to each other? How do they relate to the customers? How do they relate to the employees searching and obtaining them, especially from higher levels
