### Infinity

Optimize for maximizing money, not entirely right, but not entirely wrong.
[Time is the most valuable asset](money) and although time can buy money, money cant buy time.
Hoever, it can get you the nextb est thing: other people's time.

Still, an infinite amount of money wouldn't be ideal in the same way that an infinite amount of time wouldn't be.

Infinite amount of any activity wouldn't be enjoyable

# TOC

main intro -- infinity is worse than limited.
music - a song played ad naseum versus a few hundred plays
Food -- imagine eating the same thing every day forever
Variety is good: seasons change, innovation, adaptations.
activity of activities - grouping of activities can be seen as an activity in the span of infinity.
Existential dread -- nothing compared to the drudgery of living forever enslaved to a routine.
You don't need infinite time to be happy. By the same vein, you don't need infinite money to be happy. So how much time, or how much money, do you need to be happy?
