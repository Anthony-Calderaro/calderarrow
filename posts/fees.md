The way we measure the performance of financial advisors is flawed, and as a result, the incentives of the advisors and clients are misaligned, which results in lower trust in finanical systems, ,

- finance fees are % of principal
- finance fees do not require performance
  - benchmark
- plumber requiring payment for making the situation worse
-

Stocks are inherently risky, expertise should not be measured on a short term basis, therefore expect down years and keep paying.

Fee structure provides disincentive to users and financiers in exchange for consistent cash flows on the financier's part.

Easiest solution is that a financier does not get paid if they do not perform.
Define performance:

- Greater return than a benchmark or control
  - realized return
  - mitigation of risk
    tricky when one is present, easy when both are present or both are absent

1. realized return is higher than benchmark & volatility/risk is lower than benchmark
   Not only did their expertise yield more money for you, they did it taking on less risk. They adhered to the highest fiduciary standards -- providing reasonable returns and preserving the principal. Pay them their fee

2. Return is lower and volatility is higher
   Not only did they earn you less money, they took on more risk than needed and still lost your money. Run away.

3. Return is higher than benchmark but more risky, or return is lower but less risky
   This is difficult, because you need to sus out whether the difference in return was due to the change in risk. Generally speaking, if you strictly reward higher returns, you incentivize riskier behavior in the short term, despite lower risk, safer bets being a higher net gain on the long term due to compounding interest. A heuristic I would personally use would be that the return should be proportional to the risk, so if my portfolio is 10% more volatile, it would be considering underperformed if the return is anything less than 10% more than the benchmark. Conversely, if my portfolio was 10% less volatile, then the return should be within 10% of the benchmark, otherwise it would be considered underperforming.

When done correctly, the incentives are aligned, and the customer is always better off with the expert than without. As it is, people are living with leaky sinks because they're worried the plumbers are goign to fleece them, or worse, break the rest of their sinks. They'll keep their life savings in a 0.01% APY savings account and remain oblivious to the fact that they're losing money due to inflation.

The main disadvantage of this structure is that 1) an annual timeframe is arbitrarily short, and 2) the cash flows don't always work out with the existing rates. To mitigate this, I would propose a modest contract of 3-5 years, and a higher rate, paid out annually. If they underperform one year, they have the following year to make it up, but they don't get paid because they underperformed.

Why it matters: Trust in the financial system, and the individuals who work in it is paramount. Finance is a human activity, and the less trust that exists between participants, more resources are spent establishing trust, which drives up the cost of transacting. Everything from buying a pizza to buying a home costs more when trust declines.

It also matters for serving the underbanked, who are partially underserved because of systemic problems, but partially underserved because they don't understand the system and they don't trust it. Building a more trusting financial system lowers costs, which can result in making services more accessible for the underbanked, and has the added benefit of enticing the more skeptical of customers. And as more people participate in the system, economies of scale enable costs to be driven down even more, causing a virtuous cycle of sorts.
