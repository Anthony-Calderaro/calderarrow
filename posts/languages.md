## You Are Better Off Paying Federal Income Taxes

I may be a CPA, but I am not your CPA.

Here's the TL;DR: Paying federal income taxes nets you more money than getting a tax refund.

### How Taxes Work

You earn money each quarter. As you earn money, you owe federal income taxes, which are generally paid incrementally or squirreled away for payment at year-end. At the end of the year, you have to summarize your activities and check if you paid the proper amount based on the income tax brackets.

If you overpaid, the federal government will deposit a refund in your account (or write you a check, but this is also a suboptimal financial decision, for a similar reason). If you underpaid, you will owe the federal government the difference.

### Time Isn't Money

Time can become a lot of things, one of which is money. Time can also be sleep, food, or crushing brewskis on a Tuesday. [Time has value]() because it is scarce and has optionality, but for most financiers, extra time becomes extra money.

The point is that one would prefer to have $1 today, rather than $1 tomorrow. If I were to ask you to borrow $1, it would be reasonable for you to expect some sort of compensation for the value your dollar provides me now, which you are unable to use. That compensation usually takes the form of interest. The precise amount of interest varies based on a lot of factors, but the important thing to note is that lending someone else your money should incur a non-zero amount of interest. That is such a fundamental truth that it should be a rule. How about:

> Expected compensation for the time consideration of capital principle

Or in other terms:

> Where's my Money, Bitch?

As long as time has value, this rule should hold true.

### Your Good Friend, Uncle Sam

Friends and family are generally an exception to that rule.

### BLUF

- It means u made money
- It means u aren’t giving an interest free loan to the gov’t
  - Bad case, Q2 withholdings are in full (June), by the Time u file next april, say it takes them a month to transfer your money, you’re looking at essentially a year of interest-free loans.
    - Worsens the more you’re loaning

## Story time

- Every year, fly down to Florida to visit my grandmother. I love visiting her, and wish I got to see her more often.
- in March/April, I make a special trip — my annual pilgrimage if you will — to do her taxes. [note]
  - [note] 2 things are always true in life: Death and Taxes, but at grandma’s, it’s Pasta and Taxes
- Started out, she wanted me to use TurboTax. Even though 1) I don’t recommend it, 2) you shouldn’t use it, 3) seriously, if u take away one thing from this article, do not use turbotax. If u want me to convince you, pay me $120, and I’ll pay $15 for an off-brand tax software which is actually easier to use[tax hawk] and doesn’t spend billions [turbotax financials] in advertising and lobbying each year. Then, I’ll pay some accounting student $100 to do your taxes in a couple hours one night, then pocket the $5 for myself. I’m dead serious[email]

### Arbitrage

- Interesting opportunity for arbitrage, if u could convince people to transfer withholdings to an intermediary, who then invests the money in short-term, 0-risk instruments like CDs or T Bills
  - I hope the feds are doing this. If not, they’re literally missing out on billions each year
    - 500bn
    - 1% apY
    - 5bn per year, or 1.25bn
  - Marketing ploy to tell people “Refund America!” Where the goal is for every American to get a refund, so they force u to withhold more than u would actually need to withhold
  -

### Emotional Reasons

- Hate the gov't
- hate "losing" money at once
- poor savings habits
- Like "getting" your money back

These emotional preferences are a

## Too much of a good thing

Don't overdo it. Penalties.

### Conclusion

    - Finance is a competitive industry, and you can profit on people’s emotions.
    - Ideal situation is that the feds are giving u an interest free loan, which is why I enjoy when I have to pay taxes.
    - Love making money more than hate losing money
        - This isn’t how most people are wired [link]
    - Don’t use Turbo Tax.
