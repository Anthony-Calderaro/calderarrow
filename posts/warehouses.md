I really like warehouses.

- Hardware Stores
- wholesalers
- Aisles and Rows with multiple levels
- Reminds me of 3D spreadsheets
  How to the items relate to each other? How do they relate to the customers? How do they relate to the employees searching and obtaining them, especially from higher levels
