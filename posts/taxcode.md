### Tax Code
May 2021

Observation (unrelated): people bash the tax code for being too big or detailed, and want to throw it out and start from scratch. We see this in engineering — new devs see a “legacy” system which has worked for over a decade, using an “archaic” framework, and instead of looking at it as a wealth of knowledge which can give them a head start, they say ignorant ass shit like “we should throw it out and rewrite it in <buzzword framework that’s less than 2 years old which $CORP Made for their specific use case. How fucking disrespectful. As if the combined efforts and labor of the public servants who touch the Internal revenue code are so insignificant that it must be a conspiracy to keep the rich richer and the poor poorer.
