### It is harder to live for something

Steptember 2019

<!--
People say they'd die for something or someone. This is easy. They die once, it can be immediate, and their sacrifice has a high perceived value.

But it's superficial. It's empty. Because dying doesn't prevent the other person from dying. If anything, it delays it -- but they also have to deal with the loss of you. You're also no longer of use to the person when you're dead.

# Real World Exampls
Mask on in airplanes. If dying for a cause was the best option, why would airplanes have you put your mask on first? It's because once you're situated, you can help people for the rest of your life. If you try to help everyone else, you're limited to a single breath.

Wars are not won by dying for your country, it's by making the other bastard die for his country. -- Patton. If dieing for your country were the greatest honor, the world would be a worse place.

Don't misconstrue this -- dieing in service of a cause is noble and honorable, but it is not ideal. Your contributions to a cause end with your life, so if you truly want to further a goal, it is in your best interest to stay alive. But there are circumstances in which staying alive becomes counter to your causes' goal, and it is in these moments where self-sacrifice becomes truly the most noble cause. For instance, dying in wartime, or taking fatal wounds in order to save your team.

But in those cases, dying was not the goal, it was a means to achieve the goal.

If anything, it's lazy and selfish. You don't want to work, but you don't want to be perceived as not wanting to work. You concoct this romantic ideal of self-sacrifice being a shortcut to glory or honor.

It's much more difficult -- and honorable -- to live for a cause, to suffer for a cause, to endure for a cause. Whether that cause is your country, your family, or your future self, sacrificing and continuing to live is infinitely better than sacrificing for a single moment, and never having to experience pain or suffering again.  -->
